This is a story dating back to the December of 2015. My friends and I had set out to climb the Kedarkantha Peak in the lower Himalayas. We reached the base camp, Sankri, after a 10 hour journey. Getting down from the warm confines of the jeep, we started shivering due to the cold. Snuggling into our warm clothes and settling with a bowl of hot vegetable soup, we called it a night.

**Journey to Sankri**

On our way to the acclimatization session the next day, we met three little kids, about 10-12 years of age, with red cheeks and noses, clad in their uniforms headed for school. I introduced myself and struck a conversation with the boys, who were excited to narrate their tales of mischief back in school. While the others waved goodbye, I taught the kids how to fist bump as a cool way of greeting each other. After the kids left, we had to complete the session and get back to the base camp and prepare ourselves for the long and arduous trek to the peak the next day.

The next morning, we set out for our five day adventure. The peak was at an altitude of 13,100 feet, and we were thrilled at the prospect of conquering it. On the third day, we were finally within reach of the summit. Setting out at 4 AM in the morning, we made our way through waist deep snow, catching spectacular sights as the sun rose. This was the longest and coldest part of the trek. The view from the top was beautiful. It was snow clad mountains all around set upon the blue canvas of the sky. The silence around made it serene.

We headed back to the Aragoan camp and settled in our sleeping bags, exhausted from the trek. We had to make our descent to Sankri early the next day. The following morning I couldn’t feel my toes. I had frostbite on my feet due to the severe cold. The journey back to Sankri was long and painful. Limping slowly I made my way out of the woods and onto the road. With another 500m to go, my body refused to comply. As I sat down to take a small break, two kids came running towards me shouting “Bhaiya bhaiya” (Brother Brother). I stared in surprise as they held out their fists expecting a fist bump from me. They were the same kids I’d met on my first day. Seeing them fight over who gets to fist bump me first made me forget all my worries as I broke into laughter. Hopping along and making fun of me they accompanied me till the base camp where we said our good-byes. Despite all the pain and fatigue, I had a huge smile on my face watching the excitement of the kids. This was something that would stay with me for a long time.
