> #### “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step ” – Lao Tzu

We set out early morning on a chilly day. Taking a break from the hassles of the city. We’d set out to Mysore on the day before. In the heart of the dense forest of Bandipur is the Himavad Gopalswamy Betta. It derives its name from the dense fog (Hima = fog) that predominates and covers the hills throughout the year.  The mountain is 75 kms from the city of Mysore on the Mysore – Ooty road. You need to take a deviation after Gundlupete.

**The road to the mountain**


They often say it’s not the destination it’s the journey. Well, well said. The journey is beautiful. The view paints quite a picture. The road though motorable has a lot of potholes.

**Abode of god**


The temple dates back to the 14th century. Built by the Hoysalas, it has been maintained by the Mysore Wodeyar dynasty who worship this god. Among the many legends associated with this place is an interesting one about one of the lakes, ‘Papanasini’ (meaning the one that washes away sins). The temple priest told us that, in the hill ranges of Gopalaswamy betta, no crows are found. The crows that existed took a dip in the Papanasini and, on attaining moksha, turned into Hamsa (swan) birds and reached heaven. True to this no crows were spotted.

**Fields from top**


Although the scenery is amazing. We weren’t allowed to wander off into the mountains due to regular spotting of tigers and elephants near the temple. We headed back as the sun began to hit its peak. Another day and another mountain conquered.
